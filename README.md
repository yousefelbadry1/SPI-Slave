## Description <a name = "Description"></a>
This project involved creating a robust SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) slave that interfaces seamlessly with a single-port RAM, enabling high-speed data exchange between the SPI master and the memory. We focused on precise data communication and memory management, all driven by Verilog hardware design.
